My first own Discord bot

You can join my server https://discord.gg/QXmGDjTe9P invite it https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=772937480948547615&permissions=8&scope=bot 
or host it yourself
You'll need to create an .env with your token in the bot folder if you want to host it yourself
